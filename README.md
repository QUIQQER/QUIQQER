## What is QUIQQER?

**QUIQQER is a PHP framework designed for all kinds of web projects.**

QUIQQER has been continuously developed for over 15 years with the aim of creating a system that allows for the rapid
implementation of SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions. While it originally began as a CMS (Content Management
System), it has evolved into a highly versatile framework with more than 100 modules.

In 2024, we initiated a comprehensive restructuring, which will be completed in 2025. Going forward, QUIQQER will offer
a flexible module API and a robust administration system for users, rights, and groups.

### Create customized solutions based on your needs:

- **Want to create a blog?** Use QUIQQER + CMS + Blog Module
- **Need an e-commerce store?** Use QUIQQER + ecoyn
- **Looking for an ERP system?** Use QUIQQER + various ERP modules
- **Building a SaaS solution?** Use QUIQQER + Orders + Invoices + Memberships + Plans

Over 100 modules are already available and widely used and give you endless possibilities of how you can use QUIQQER. As the setup can sometimes be complex, we plan to release tutorials and videos in 2025 to help you get started.

As strong supporters of open source, the core of QUIQQER is free and open source. Whether you're looking to build a
SaaS, ERP, website, blog, ordering system, store, or MVP, QUIQQER has the tools to support you.
