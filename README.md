QUIQQER would of course not exist without the help of some busy developers and projects. 
With this in mind we would like to say thank you to the many software packages which already exist and will be further developed.

- Composer (http://getcomposer.org)
- MooTools (http://mootools.net/)
- requirejs (requirejs.org/)
- AMD css! plugin curl.js (https://github.com/cujojs/curl)
- moofx (https://github.com/kamicane/moofx/)
- Font Awesome (http://fontawesome.io/)
- Basis and idea for the QUIQQER Font: http://fontfabric.com/multicolore-free-fonts/
- Alle the Webstuff (PHP, Apache, NGINX)

Of course we forgot some of them and can't list everything here. 
For all the lines of code we forgot we say thank you for the great work.
